**INFILTRATED TABLECLOTHS**

In Paraguay, every neighborhood has "comedores populares"—family-run eateries where millions make daily dining decisions. They all share one thing: plastic tablecloths printed with colorful fruit patterns. A visual code so ubiquitous it became invisible.

Until now.

Pulp, a Paraguayan juice brand, infiltrated this cultural canvas. We redesigned traditional tablecloths, seamlessly embedding Pulp bottles among the existing fruit illustrations. Orange juice bottles appeared between oranges. Grapefruit drinks nestled beside grapefruits. The brand didn't interrupt the pattern—it became part of it.

The result: advertising that doesn't look like advertising. A medium that reaches consumers at the exact moment of purchase decision, on surfaces they trust because they've known them their whole lives.

We didn't add a new advertising space. We activated one that was always there, hiding in plain sight on every table in Paraguay.

**Manteles Infiltrados: The tablecloth became the medium.**
